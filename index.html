  <h3> Introduction </h3>
  <p> Hello and Welcome all to my first ever personal web site! Please note, that this web site is currently under daily constuction
    and for the moment only serves me as a tool to develop my programing skills, hence the current web functionalities as well as
    content are low level. In any case I am excited to be developing my first web site.
    <br>In the current stage of my
    professional life it would be most precise to describe myself as an aspirin full stack developer with initial professional background
    in Economics (BA degree in 2008) and a 7 years working experience in retail supply chain management of an international company
    <a href="http://corporate.senukai.lt/"> <em> KESKO Senukai Lithuania</em></a> . Besides that I am an amateur basketball player,
    a loving husband and a father of one lovely boy. Currently I am voluntarily unemployed with the purpose of concentrating on
    reaching my goals in programming and web development in the shortest time possible. Which I found myself to be very passionate about.
    Speaking of my current proffesional goal in programming - it is to become a capable and versatile full stack developer and programmer.
