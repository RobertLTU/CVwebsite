My first ever HTML practice code, first github repository and first ever published web page :) Hurray!!!! 
And now I am also practicing my GIT skills on it (Cloning, Pushing, Merging to remote repository using GIT Bash command line). So far so good. Thank you CORREY SCHAFER for amazing video tutorials on GIT command line.
